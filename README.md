### What is this?
This is a collection of all 2019-2020 OPA closed case summaries, in both pdf and plain-text format. The ability to easily search all the plain-text summaries will hopefully make it easier to locate particular OPA verdicts.

### Improvements
Pull requests to add features to the tools or update the content are always welcome. These improvements, in particular, would be helpful (and are sorted by importance):
- Tooling for pulling pre-2019 OPA cases
- Tooling for pulling on-going case information
- Tooling for aggregating / summarizing cases (chronological, by title, with links? not sure)
- Built-in scripts for querying (I don't really know who will use this, so for now, I'm assuming grep / windows finder / etc. will do)
- Some automation when new cases arrive
