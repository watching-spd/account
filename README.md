### What is this?
This is a collection of all 2019-2020 OPA closed case summaries, in both pdf and plain-text format, as well as tools for fetching & transforming these summaries. Hopefully, this will make it easier to locate particular OPA verdicts.

### Help, I've never used github and I don't know what's happening
That's ok! Click the green "Code" button in the top-right, then click "Download ZIP", then unzip it and search it with your preferred tool. Plain text files are located at `summaries/txt`, and the PDFs are at `summaries/pdf`.

### Improvements
Pull requests to add features to the tool or update the content are always welcome. These improvements, in particular, would be helpful (and are sorted by importance):
- Tooling for pulling pre-2019 OPA cases
- Tooling for pulling on-going case information
- Tooling for aggregating / summarizing cases
  - Chronological sort / table, including title, links, verdict / outcome?
- Built-in scripts for querying (I don't really know who will use this, so for now, I'm assuming grep / windows finder / etc. will do)
- Some automation when new cases arrive
