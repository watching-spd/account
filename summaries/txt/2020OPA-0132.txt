Imposed DisciplineWritten Reprimand

This Closed Case Summary (CCS) represents the opinion of the OPA Director regarding the misconduct alleged and therefore sections are written in the first person. 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

The Complainant, a department supervisor, alleged multiple violations of SPD policies on the part of Named 
Employee #1 (NE#1). First, NE#1 was alleged to have failed to activate her In Car Video. While NE#1 activated her 
Body Worn Video (BWV), it was not activated prior to her arrival on the call and NE#1 did not notify the subject of 
the recording. NE#1 was also alleged to have mishandled the investigation into this incident. Notably, an individual 
matching the suspect description was located by other officers; however, NE#1 said that the suspect did not match 
the descriptionand asserted that the reporting party did not want anything done. NE#1’s statement that the 
individual did not match the suspect description was incorrect. The victim also indicated that he was, in fact, 
interested in pursuing the matter. The individual was later released at the scene on the direction of NE#1 despite 
the individual being the correct suspect. Lastly, NE#1 was also alleged to have been unprofessional when she 
referred to the requirements of the trespass admonishment program as “annoying” andwhen she described the 
reporting party “old” and, thus, not technologically savvy to fellow officers. 

ADMINISTRATIVE NOTE:

OPA asked NE#1 if shewould like to process hercase under Rapid Adjudication (RA). RA is provided for in the Seattle 
Police Officers’ Guild’s collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the City. It allows for employees to recognize that 

v.2020 09 17their conduct was inconsistent with Department policies and standards, and to accept discipline for the policy 
violation rather than undergoing a full OPA investigation.

After reviewing the complaint and completing its intake investigation, OPA determined this case could be 
appropriate for resolution by RA. However, before proceeding with its recommendation, OPA sought the Office of 
Inspector General’s (OIG) input. The OIG concurred with the OPA’s determination. Consistent with the procedure in 
the CBA, OPA forwarded to the Chief of Police its recommended disposition and proposed discipline in the form of a 
writtenreprimand. The Chief of Police concurred with OPA’s recommended findings and proposed discipline. NE#1 
also agreed to the discipline and, in doing so, stipulated that the finding and discipline were final and could not be 
appealed or otherwise later disputed.

ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS:

Named Employee #1 -Allegations #15.100 -Operations Bureau Individual Responsibilities 2. Monitor and take appropriate action regarding criminal activity in assigned area

SPD Policy 5.100(I)(A) requires that officers’ performance meet certain standards. This includes that they: “Monitor 
and take appropriate action regarding criminal activity in assigned area”; “Maintain close contact with the 
community”; “Display…necessary interpersonal skills…”; “Demonstrate consistent work habits which reflect a high 
standard of performance and initiative”; and “Remain professional at all times.”

The failures of NE#1 as identified by the reporting supervisor and as detailed above were in violation of SPD policy. 
By agreeing to proceed with RA, NE#1 recognized that heractions, including her lack of a complete investigation, her 
failure to activate ICV, and her statements,violated SPD Policy 5.100(2). OPA appreciates and commends NE#1 for 
taking accountability for this incident and for agreeing to RA. OPA accordingly recommends this allegation be 
Sustained –Rapid Adjudication. This finding is both final and binding.
